        Hi, I'm a student at The University of the Immaculate Conception
        doing his best to actually have deccent grades but Honestly 
        struggling to but still wouldn't give up. I really love to develop
        games, play testing them, and also a little bit of 3D animation.
        My go to Sports would be Bowling, and before anyone asks, ofcourse
        I do my best to juggle my hobbies and school work. 
      </p>
          <h5>School Projects</h5>
<p>well throughout my school life, there were tons of assignments, projects and group meetings 
that I had to participate in, most of them were simple and easy while others are quiet difficult
and challenging that all of them to me is just this one huge blur, one thing that I do remember
was winning a golden medal on my S.I.P project, however I heavily credit the team other than me
myself.</p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Talents</h5>
<p>I like to think that my confidence would be part of a talent, I think it's the self acceptance
and love for myself is what caused my own self confidence to flourish, because of this I feel quiet
confident In reportingss, however it still did not cure my nervousness, I take great pleassure on 
knowing what I can provide in group projects and roles.</p>
